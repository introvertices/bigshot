Toonboom Producer, whadda pieca shit huh. 

Well, here is a small script to help poor tech artists and compositors not want to blow their brains out dealing with hundreds of nested folders.

All you need is a directory to copy your shots to, a shot code that is consistent across your production (for example an episode number), and the abiliy to press the enter key.

May you never have to manually copy and paste this bullshit again, bless thine wrists, amen.



it probably has some quirko behaviour that makes it break sometimes, but you know what? You can fix it however you like <3 I don't get paid enough to
